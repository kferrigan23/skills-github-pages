Be careful when working with free themes from uncertain developers. Often, they contain encrypted parts and code that can hurt your site and its presence on Google. Always look for user reviews before choosing a theme. Most importantly, the safest bet is getting your free themes only from the official WordPress directory at https://wordpress.org/themes/. The themes there have been tested and checked for any suspicious code. You can learn more about this whole issue at http://newinternetorder.com/free- wordpress-themes-are-evil/.

Essentially, WordPress.org is about developing the platform itself, sharing new plugins, discussing the technical aspects of WordPress, and being all techie in general. WordPress.com is a commercial website where bloggers can meet with each other and publish their blog content under the wordpress.com subdomain (for example, something like paleorecipeslog.wordpress.com is a subdomain).

If you prefer to visit the website, then the most important spot to visit or subscribe to is WordPress Releases. Whenever there is a new release, be it a major release, or an interim bug fix, or an upgrade, it will be at https://wordpress.org/news/category/releases/. Also, be sure to stay tuned to the main WordPress blog at https://wordpress.org/news/. Some additional resources worth mentioning are as follows: https://wordpress.org/: The absolute main hub for WordPress. https://wordpress.com/: The commercial service for creating blogs and websites. http://jobs.wordpress.net/: Job listings for anyone searching for employment in areas related to WordPress (or anyone searching for WordPress help). https://wordpress.tv/: A great source of top-notch WordPress tutorials, how- to advice, case studies, product demonstrations, and WordPress-related conference presentation recordings. https://central.wordcamp.org/: WordCamp is a conference that focuses on everything WordPress; it takes place a number of times during the year in different locations around the world, and this site is the central point for the conference.
